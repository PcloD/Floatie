# Floating tooltip for Unity

See the [example video][vid]

Use this script to spawn a floating object in front of the camera, and
optionally have a line pointing to an object of interest.

Useful for VR, when you need to draw user's attention to a point out of sight.

Example scene requires [SteamVR asset][svr] to be added to the project.
